Net revenue increased to $35.57 billion from $30.35 billion in the year-ago quarter.\nJPMorgan Chase beat the Wall Street earnings estimates of $3.08 a share and revenue of $34.35 billion, according to data compiled by FactSet.\nAnalysts have been reducing their profit forecasts for JP Morgan in the days leading up to its fourth-quarter results with the latest estimate of $3.08 a share, down from $3.15 a share on Dec. 30, according to FactSet data. But the bank still topped the more bullish forecast of $3.15.\nShares of JPMorgan Chase fell 0.4%.\nPeter Torrente, KPMG U.S. national sector leader for banking and capital markets, said the earnings from JPMorgan and other big bankers were solid, with results driven by profit from loans, which the banks report as net interest income.\nCredit reserves increased significantly over the past year and investment banking fees remained impacted by the lackluster deal-making environment.\n\u201cMuch like the last quarter, the magnifying glass for the industry continues to hover on the macroeconomic outlook for 2023 focusing on credit losses, loan demand and deposits as trailing indicators of turbulence,\u201d Torrente said.\nBank of America  BAC, +0.54% stock dipped 1.5% after the financial firm beat its earnings and revenue targets as it benefitted from higher interest rates on its loans.\nBank of America said it earned $7.1 billion, or 85 cents a share in the fourth quarter, compared to $7 billion, or 82 cents a share, in the year-ago quarter. Revenue, net of interest expense, increased by 11% to $24.5 billion.\nWall Street analysts expected earnings of 77 cents a share on revenue of $24.17 billion, according to data compiled by FactSet.\nNet interest income rose 29%, or $3.3 billion, to $14.7 billion, \u201cdriven by benefits from higher interest rates, including lower premium amortization expense, and solid loan growth,\u201d the bank said.\nWells Fargo & Co. WFC, -1.03% stock dropped 2.5% after its fourth-quarter revenue missed expectations.\nThe bank said its fourth-quarter profit fell by about half to $2.59 billion, or 67 cents a share, from $5.47 billion, or $1.38 a share in the year-ago quarter. That\u2019s ahead of the analyst estimate of 60 cents a share.\nRevenue declined 5.7% to $19.66 billion, against an analyst consensus of $19.99 billion.\nNet interest income increased by 45% to $13.43 billion.\nWells Fargo also projected 10% growth in 2023 net interest income to about $49.5 billion, which is below the latest analyst estimate of $51.69 billion.\nThe bank said earlier this week that it was reducing the size of its home-mortgage business. It also said that consumer banking and lending loans increased 4% and commercial banking loans climbed 18%.\nWells Fargo also previously disclosed an impact of 70 cents a share from litigation and regulatory matters including a recent settlement with the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\nCitigroup C, +0.63% stock dipped 0.1% after the bank posted a lower profit. Fourth-quarter net income fell to $2.5 billion, or $1.16, from $3.2 billion, or $1.46 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.14 a share, according to a survey by FactSet.\nRevenue increased 6% to $18.0 billion, slightly above the analyst estimate of $17.96 billion.\nExcluding divestments, revenue rose 5%, as the impacts of higher interest rates across businesses and the strong loan growth in U.S. personal banking were partially offset by a decline in investment banking and lower investment product revenue in global wealth management as well as impacts from the exited markets.\nAhead of bank earnings, analysts at Keefe, Bruyette & Woods said they expect strong net interest income growth from the big banks as higher interest rates allow them to charge more to lend money. At the same time, activity has been weak in investment banking and mortgage lending.\nOverall, however, U.S. consumers remain have relatively low unemployment numbers despite an increase in layoffs of late.\nWith the earnings from the big banks, Wall Street is looking for clues on the health of the economy and the impact of higher interest rates and inflation.\nShares of the big banks have been moving up in 2023 but are still well below year-ago levels.\nAs of Thursday\u2019s close, JPMorgan stock has risen 4% in 2023 but it\u2019s down 16.7% in the past 12 months. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.12% is now up 3.2% for the year, and down by 5.7% over the past 12 months, while the S&P 500 SPX, -0.19% rose 3.7% in 2023 while falling 15.5% in the past 12 months.\nBank of America stock is up 4.1% for 2023 and down by 30% in the past year. Wells Fargo stock has risen 3.7% in 2023 and lost 23.6% in the past year. Citigroup is up 8.5% so far in 2023 and is lower by 26.9% in the past year.\nWith potential competition for deposits from consumers, banks may have to pay out higher interest rates for account holder products such as CDs which could eat into margins.\nAnother key metric is asset quality, which is affected by the quality of the loan portfolio and the credit administration program. If these numbers start to weaken, it could offer more clues about a potential recession.\nIn an interview this week at the JPMorgan Healthcare Conference, JPMorgan CEO Dimon also unleashed some fresh barbs against cryptocurrencies and criticized the crypto-trading platform FTX, which filed for bankruptcy late last year.\nThe outspoken Dimon had warned against what he termed an economic hurricane in a widely quoted interview in June.\nDimon revisited the remarks on Tuesday in an interview on Fox Business on the show Mornings with Maria. \n\u201cI shouldn\u2019t have ever used the word \u2018hurricane,'\u201d Dimon said in the interview. \u201cWhat I said was there were storm clouds which may mitigate. People said they didn\u2019t think it was a big deal, and I said no, those storm clouds could be a hurricane. And so I\u2019m saying this stuff, I\u2019m talking about \u2026 it could be nothing [or] it could be bad, and I think we should understand, I\u2019m not predicting one or the other.\u201d\nAlso this week, BlackRock Inc. BLK, -0.44% added its name to the growing list of financial and other companies cutting jobs with plans to reduce its workforce for the first time since 2019.\nAlso Read: BlackRock cutting 500 jobs or less than 3% of workforce\nOn Tuesday, Goldman Sachs is forecast to report earnings of $5.56 a share on revenue of $10.76 billion and Morgan Stanley is expected to report a profit of $1.29 a share on revenue of $12.54 billion, according to the latest analyst estimates.\n", "summary": "summary to be filled here", "key": "Finviz_MarketWatch", "date": "Jan-13", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/jpmorgan-wells-fargo-and-bank-of-america-beat-earnings-expectations-but-worries-about-headwinds-remain-11673614712"}

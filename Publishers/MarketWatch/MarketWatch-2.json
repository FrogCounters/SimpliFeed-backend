{"title": ": Telsa stock sinks after more price cuts prompts Guggenheim to recommend investors sell", "total_text": "Shares of Tesla Inc. TSLA, -2.89% took a 5.7% dive in morning Friday, after the electric vehicle maker started discounting some of its U.S. EVs, which prompted Guggenheim to recommend investors sell. The stock, which was currently the 2nd-worst performer in the S&P 500 SPX, -0.21%, was pulling back after rallying 14.3% in a little over a week, since closing at a 2 1/2-year low of $108.10 on Jan. 3. The EV discounts posted on Tesla\u2019s website late Thursday came a week after the company cut prices in China for the second time in three months. Guggenheim\u2019s Ronald Jewsikow lowered his rating to sell from neutral, and established a price target of $89, which implied about 24% downside from current levels. He said Wall Street estimates are \u201cfar too optimistic\u201d ahead of fourth-quarter results, which are due out on Jan. 25, and 2023 estimates also need to be reset amid the \u201cglobal price cut wave.\u201d Tesla\u2019s stock has plunged 47.4% over the past three months, while the S&P 500 has gained 8.0%.\n", "summary": "summary to be filled here", "key": "Finviz_MarketWatch", "date": "Jan-13", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/telsa-stock-sinks-after-more/story.aspx?guid={20C06575-04D4-B545-717D-A116FD01A2AA}&siteid=rss"}

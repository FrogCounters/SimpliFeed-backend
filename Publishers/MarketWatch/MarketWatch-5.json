{"title": ": Citi net income falls but beats target, shares dip", "total_text": "Citigroup Inc. C, +0.65% shares fell 2.4% in premarket trades on Friday after the bank posted lower profit. Fourth-quarter net income fell to $2.5 billion, or $1.16, from $3.2 billion, or $1.46 a share, in the year-ago quarter. Analysts were looking for earnings of $1.14 a share, according to a survey by FactSet. Revenue increased 6% to $18.0 billion, slightly above the analyst estimate of $17.96 billion. Excluding divestments, revenue rose 5%, as the impacts of higher interest rates across businesses and the strong loan growth in U.S. personal banking were partially offset by a decline in investment banking and lower investment product revenue in global wealth management as well as impacts from the exited markets.\n", "summary": "summary to be filled here", "key": "Finviz_MarketWatch", "date": "Jan-13", "url": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story/citi-net-income-falls-beats/story.aspx?guid={20C06575-04D4-B545-717D-8738C2837E63}&siteid=rss"}
